    body: `<p>Energy operators already collect a large volume of equipment, inspection, and field data. The challenge is connecting those records to a decision that a maintenance or operations team can make with confidence.</p>
      <h2>Start with an operational question</h2><p>Choose a bounded question such as which assets need inspection first. Identify the data owners, the decision maker, and the evidence required before any model is built. This prevents a dashboard from becoming another isolated destination for information.</p>
      <h2>Build a dependable signal path</h2><p>Join telemetry to asset registers, maintenance history, and operating context. Check completeness, timestamps, and changes in equipment configuration. A predictive signal without this context can be misleading.</p>
      <h2>Keep the team in control</h2><p>Use analytics to rank and explain exceptions, then let qualified people validate the recommendation. Monitor false alerts and missed events after deployment. The value comes from better planning and traceable action, not from claiming that a model can replace field judgment.</p>

    body: `<p>Fraud teams need to identify unusual activity without overwhelming investigators with weak alerts. AI can help prioritize work, but a useful system must fit the institution's controls and review process.</p>
      <h2>Combine signals with context</h2><p>Transaction patterns alone rarely explain a case. Bring together authorized account, device, behavior, and case-history data while documenting lineage and access. Separate a risk score from the decision to act.</p>
      <h2>Design for investigation</h2><p>Show which signals contributed to an alert, what evidence is missing, and which actions require approval. Investigators should be able to record outcomes so the system can be evaluated against real decisions over time.</p>
      <h2>Measure the whole workflow</h2><p>Review alert volume, false positives, time to disposition, and the impact on legitimate customers. Privacy and model governance must be addressed before deployment, not after a pilot expands.</p>

      <h2>Extract, then verify</h2><p>Document AI can classify incoming material and propose fields or summaries. Each extracted fact should remain connected to its source. Confidence thresholds and exception queues help route uncertain cases to a person.</p>
      <h2>Respect the decision boundary</h2><p>Automation can prepare a file, identify missing information, and suggest the next review step. Coverage judgments and consequential decisions need explicit ownership and appropriate human review.</p>
      <h2>Improve the process, not just the model</h2><p>Track rework, document quality, review time, and the reasons staff override suggested outputs. These signals reveal whether the workflow is actually becoming more useful.</p>

      <h2>Define the audience and sources</h2><p>A staff knowledge assistant should retrieve only approved material for the user's role. Source ownership, revision dates, and access permissions matter as much as search quality.</p>
      <h2>Make uncertainty visible</h2><p>Answers should cite the underlying document and make it easy to inspect. When sources conflict or the question goes beyond the system's scope, the assistant should say so and direct the user to an appropriate person.</p>
      <h2>Keep clinical judgment separate</h2><p>Knowledge access is not a substitute for a clinician's assessment. Evaluate privacy, accuracy, accessibility, and escalation before expanding the workflow to more sensitive contexts.</p>

      <h2>Establish a usable baseline</h2><p>Map sensors to the correct equipment and record operating modes, maintenance events, and known failure conditions. Quality checks should catch missing periods and instrumentation changes before alerts are trusted.</p>
      <h2>Prioritize actionable exceptions</h2><p>Present risk alongside production schedules, spare-parts availability, and safety constraints. An alert that cannot be investigated or scheduled has limited operational value.</p>
