    overview: "Generative AI helps people work with enterprise information; agentic AI can coordinate bounded steps across approved tools. Both require reliable sources, clear permissions, evaluation, and human oversight before they belong in everyday operations.",

The business value comes from fitting these capabilities into a known workflow with measurable quality and accountable decisions.",

      { question: "When should an agent require approval?", answer: "Approval should match the impact and reversibility of an action. External communication, record changes, financial commitments, and security actions generally need explicit control." },
